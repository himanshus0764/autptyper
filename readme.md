# AutoTyper

The AutoTyper is a Python script that automates text typing tasks character by character. It provides a simple and efficient way to simulate keyboard input and type predefined text sequences, making it useful for various automation and scripting purposes.

## Description

The AutoTyper script utilizes the `xdotool` command-line tool to simulate keyboard input and type text character by character. Users can specify the text to be typed and adjust typing speed settings to control the rate at which text is typed. Additionally, the script supports reading text from external text files, providing flexibility in text input.

## Features

- **Text Typing**: The script types predefined text sequences character by character, simulating keyboard input.
- **Adjustable Typing Speed**: Users can specify the typing speed in seconds per character, allowing customization of typing speed settings.
- **Text File Input**: The script supports reading text from external text files, enabling users to type large or predefined text sequences.
- **Command-line Interface**: The script can be run from the command line, providing convenience and flexibility in usage.

## Usage

1. **Run Script**: Execute the `autotyper.py` script from the command line or terminal.
   
2. **Specify Typing Speed**: Optionally, specify the typing speed in seconds per character using the `--speed` argument. If not specified, the script will prompt the user to enter the typing speed interactively.
   
3. **Select Text File**: If typing text from a file, select the text file containing the text to be typed using the file dialog prompt.
   
4. **Start Typing**: The script will begin typing the text character by character after a specified delay, providing feedback on the typing progress.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- xdotool command-line tool (install using `sudo apt-get install xdotool` on Debian-based systems)

## Note

- The AutoTyper script is designed for automating text typing tasks and simulating keyboard input. Users are encouraged to use the script responsibly and ensure compliance with relevant regulations and guidelines.
